Additionally, I set up CI/CD pipelines with Docker to ensure seamless deployment and system stability, along with other key functionalities.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Personal Projects</b> (December 2022 - Present): Worked on projects like ChainPortal, a platform for minting and bridging Web3 assets across blockchains and Solana Mystery Box Shop, an automated webshop generating passive income by selling randomized Web3 assets.
